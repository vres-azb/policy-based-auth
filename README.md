# Policy-based Authorization Demo

This demo exemplified the separation of concerns of `authentication` and `authorization`. The same way you centralize the authentication to an `Identity Provider`, you should do the same for an `Authorization Provider`.

The scenario presented is on a common use case for iVal, as defined in the `Role Based Matrix.xls`.
